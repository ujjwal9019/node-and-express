blocking vs non blocking 

blocking  = 

It refers to the blocking of further operation until the current operation finishes. Blocking methods are executed synchronously. Synchronously means that the program is executed line by line. The program waits until the called function or the operation returns.


 non blocking  = 
 
It refers to the program that does not block the execution of further operations. Non-Blocking methods are executed asynchronously. Asynchronously means that the program may not necessarily execute line by line. The program calls the function and move to the next operation and does not wait for it to return

Note = It is good practice to write Non Blocking code because we have limited threads in blocking operation  interm of scailabilty it fails
